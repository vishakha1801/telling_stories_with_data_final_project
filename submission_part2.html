    <h2>🧱 How LEGO Grew Up: From System of Play to Adult Collectible</h2>

    <h3>What this project is doing differently from Part I</h3>
    <p>
      Part I established that LEGO has evolved in complexity. Part II moves beyond identifying change and instead clarifies
      <em>how that change is experienced</em> by the reader. This document reframes the work as an intentional narrative journey
      that combines data, memory, and cultural analysis.
    </p>
    <p>This iteration integrates feedback by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clearly defining the audience and emotional purpose</li>
      <li>Anchoring quantitative trends in specific, recognizable LEGO sets</li>
      <li>Strengthening the connective thread between visuals</li>
      <li>Introducing user research and design-driven revisions</li>
      <li>Moving from analytical description to purposeful storytelling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is not simply an extension of Part I. It is the working blueprint for how the final data story will be experienced.
    </p>

    <h2>🎯 Audience & Story Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The primary audience for this project is <strong>adult LEGO fans and design-curious readers</strong> — people who have
      emotional familiarity with LEGO but may not have deeply reflected on how the brand has changed. This includes AFOLs,
      nostalgic builders, visual storytelling enthusiasts, and readers interested in cultural brand evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is not to judge LEGO’s transformation as positive or negative, but to make the shift
      <em>visible and legible</em>. By tracing how LEGO moved from small, modular toys to large-scale, display-oriented collectibles,
      the story invites readers to reflect on their own relationship with LEGO and ask:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      As LEGO increasingly prioritizes complexity, realism, and franchise fidelity, what happens to the open-ended creativity that once defined the brick?
    </blockquote>
    <p>This question drives the entire narrative.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>🧩 Narrative Structure & Visual Walkthrough (Storyboard)</h2>
    <p>The story unfolds in three connected sections that reflect LEGO’s transformation across time.</p>

    <h3>Section 1: The Era of Standardization (1950–1990)</h3>
    <p>
      This section establishes LEGO as a restrained, modular system designed to emphasize compatibility and imagination.
      Sets like <em>236 Garage with Automatic Door</em> (1956) and early Town Plan vehicles are intentionally small, formulaic,
      and limited in color. Even with innovations such as early Technic gears, LEGO maintains low complexity to prioritize
      creativity over structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Visual &amp; Narrative Intent:</strong> To make visible the long period where LEGO’s identity was rooted in restraint
      and modular freedom — not scale.
    </p>

    <h4>Visualization: Growth of LEGO Scale (Average Pieces Per Set)</h4>
    <iframe src="fig1_avg_pieces_per_set.html" width="100%" height="550" style="border:none;"></iframe>
    <p>
      This chart shows a sustained flat pattern through the early decades, visually reinforcing LEGO’s original design philosophy:
      simple systems that encouraged open-ended play rather than structural spectacle.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Section 2: The Complexity Shift (1995–2010)</h3>
    <p>
      This phase marks the turning point. As entertainment shifted toward screen-driven narratives, LEGO leaned into realism,
      expressive characters, and engineering challenge. Sets like <em>Black Seas Barracuda</em> and early Star Wars models
      introduced cinematic storytelling, while Bionicle transformed LEGO from system-driven play to character-based identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expansion of color, specialized pieces, and mechanical functions signals LEGO’s transition from abstraction to realism.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Visual &amp; Narrative Intent:</strong> To highlight the inflection point where LEGO begins to look more like a
      structured model than a creative playground.
    </p>

    <h4>Visualization: A Crowd of Bricks</h4>
    <iframe src="fig2_crowd_of_bricks.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
    <p>
      The increasing density and vertical spread of dots visually communicates the growing complexity and scale of LEGO sets —
      a subtle foreshadowing of LEGO’s transformation into a more monumental medium.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h3>Section 3: The Franchise &amp; AFOL Era (2011–Present)</h3>
    <p>
      In this era, LEGO becomes a collectible cultural artifact. Sets such as the <em>UCS Millennium Falcon</em>,
      <em>Colosseum</em>, and <em>Porsche 911 GT3 RS</em> prioritize display, nostalgia, and technical mastery.
      The brand positions itself as both design object and emotional symbol for adult audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      This period reflects LEGO’s alignment with fandom, luxury aesthetics, and premium identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Visual &amp; Narrative Intent:</strong> To demonstrate LEGO’s audience shift and its repositioning from universal toy
      to prestige collectible.
    </p>

    <h4>Visualization: Who LEGO Is Building For</h4>
    <iframe src="fig4_licensed_vs_original_share.html" width="100%" height="550" style="border:none;"></iframe>
    <p>
      This treemap reveals the dominance of licensed IP — Star Wars, Marvel, and other franchises — visually confirming LEGO’s
      evolution into a product driven by nostalgia and fandom.
    </p>

    <h4>Visualization: LEGO’s Flagship Beasts</h4>
    <iframe src="fig3_big_lego_sets.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
    <p>
      These culturally iconic sets serve as the emotional climax of the story, reinforcing that LEGO has entered territory once
      reserved for art, architecture, and collectible design.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>📊 Final Visual Set for Part II</h2>
    <p>The four visualizations retained for the storyboard are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Growth of LEGO Scale (Average Pieces Per Set)</li>
      <li>A Crowd of Bricks (Scatter of LEGO Set Complexity)</li>
      <li>Who LEGO Is Building For (Licensed vs Original Share)</li>
      <li>LEGO’s Flagship Beasts (Iconic Mega Sets)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These charts together create a cohesive emotional arc:
      <strong>Restraint → Transition → Monumentalization</strong>
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>👥 User Research Protocol</h2>

    <h3>Research Goal</h3>
    <p>
      To evaluate whether the narrative clearly communicates LEGO’s evolution and whether readers feel emotionally grounded in
      both the visuals and examples.
    </p>

    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
    <p>
      Casual LEGO fans and design-interested readers aged 20–35, familiar with LEGO but not necessarily experts.
    </p>

    <h3>Participant Selection</h3>
    <p>
      Three individuals were selected through peer networks, representing a mix of nostalgic LEGO users and casual observers.
    </p>

    <h3>Interview Script</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the main story you think this is trying to tell?</li>
      <li>Which visuals feel most clear or unclear?</li>
      <li>Do the examples of specific LEGO sets help you understand the trends?</li>
      <li>What would make this story more engaging or meaningful?</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h2>💬 User Research Findings</h2>
    <p>
      Participants universally understood the broader narrative but expressed a desire for stronger emotional grounding through
      recognizable sets and visual nostalgia.
    </p>
    <p>Key observations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Specific LEGO set references significantly increased engagement</li>
      <li>Clear audience framing made the story feel more personal and intentional</li>
      <li>Visual context worked best when paired with iconic cultural examples</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Notable quotes:</p>
    <blockquote>
      “I like knowing what changed, but I want to see the actual boxes I remember — that’s what makes it hit.”
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      “This feels more powerful when it’s clearly about fans, not just LEGO as a company.”
    </blockquote>

    <hr>

    <h2>🔧 Design Changes Informed by Feedback</h2>
    <p>In response, I have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Embedded named LEGO sets throughout the narrative</li>
      <li>Strengthened visual annotations connecting data to real products</li>
      <li>Reframed the introduction to emphasize nostalgia and memory</li>
      <li>Clarified the emotional purpose of each visualization</li>
      <li>Reduced overly academic framing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These changes ensure the story feels cohesive, emotionally resonant, and anchored in lived experience.
